# Budge-It

This is Budge-It!! I will hopefully come up with a better name for it,
eventually. In the meantime, this will work.


## What is it?

Budgets stuff!!! Yeah there's plenty of things for this already blah blah blah.
But none of them quite have all the stuff I want. Hopefully in the end this will
do all of the things I want out of budgeting software.

Most likely it'll be taking some inspiration from [Homebank][], [Mint][], and
[GNUCash][]. Check them out!
